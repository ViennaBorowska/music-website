        Hi there, I'm a junior fullstack developer based in Manchester, NW U.K.{" "}
        <br></br>
        <br></br>I am a fast learner in posession of a passion to do good, and a
        keen problem-solving mind. I like to approach problems like a detective
        solving a mystery, working ceaselessly and methodically until a solution
        is reached.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>I am highly organised with critical attention to detail, so I
        have found my skills well suited to back-end development - but I also
        have a strong creative flair and enjoy building attractive, accessible,
        responsive designs.
