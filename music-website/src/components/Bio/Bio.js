    <p className="about-me">
      Hi there, I'm a junior fullstack developer based in Manchester, NW U.K.{" "}
      <br></br>
      <br></br>I am a fast learner in posession of a passion to do good, and a
      keen problem-solving mind. I like to approach problems like a detective
      solving a mystery, working ceaselessly and methodically until a solution
      is reached.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>I am highly organised with critical attention to detail, so I
      have found my skills well suited to back-end development - but I also have
      a strong creative flair and enjoy building attractive, accessible,
      responsive designs.
